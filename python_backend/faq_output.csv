Email: transcripts@grad.gatech.edu"
New Student Onboarding/GT Email Account,2,What happens if I do not submit my official transcript(s) and any other required official documents?,"If you are a new student starting Spring 2024, you will NOT have a missing document hold placed on your
account for transcripts until after registration has ended.
However, you will want to ensure that you submit all required official transcripts/documents as soon as possible to
avoid future holds, especially since those holds could prevent your ability to withdraw from a course in your first
semester, as well as your ability to register/withdraw from future semesters."
New Student Onboarding/GT Email Account,3,Is there an orientation for the OMSCS program?,"Since this is an online program, we do not have a formal or in-person orientation for OMSCS students through the
OMSCS Advising office. However, we encourage you to access general onboarding information online. Next, we
encourage you to watch our OMSCS Orientation video playlist. Finally, a wiki was created for new and existing
students in the OMSCS program, but please note that since OMSCS Advising did not contribute to this document,
we cannot guarantee that all of the information is up-to-date and fully accurate."
New Student Onboarding/GT Email Account,4,What are the expectations regarding my GT email account?,"The Institute, as well as the department, will use your Georgia Tech email address as your official contact.
You are required to keep it active, and you are expected to read your email DAILY as per the Institute’s
policy. This is true even if you are not enrolled that particular semester.
***Also, even if you have arranged for your GT email to be forwarded to your personal account, we encourage you
to check your GT email account directly and often, as we have heard from students on multiple occasions that
their forwarding service did not always work properly. No exceptions will be made simply because you missed an
email that was sent by our department and/or the Institute.***
Please pay special attention to any messages sent from omscs-official@cc.gatech.edu, as important
announcements typically are sent from this account. Since this account is the official mailing list for all OMSCS

become a TA for a future semester. Please be sure to monitor your email for this information."
Institute Services & Course-Related Resources,7,What if I have an issue with/complaint about an assignment/exam or my instructor/TA?,"Unfortunately, OMSCS Advising cannot get involved in the classroom management of OMSCS courses. If you
need to request an extension due to health, family, or other unforeseen issues, please consult your class’ syllabus
for directions and/or contact the Dean of Students office using the Request Assistance form, available on their

pursue internship experiences should their schedules allow for it."
Institute Services & Course-Related Resources,13,What career resources are available to me as an OMSCS student?,"OMSCS students can receive career support from multiple sources. First, OMSCS students have access to
career services specifically for assistance with job searching, interviewing, networking, career planning, and
professional development. Please visit https://omscs.gatech.edu/career to learn more. If you sign up for the
omscs-announce mailing list, you will receive regular communications from the Office of Outreach, Enrollment,
and Community (OEC) for the College of Computing, including opportunities to participate in professional
development workshops and webinars.
Also, please be sure to check out our job platform, Handshake (you will be required to log in using your GT
credentials). Here, OMSCS students can see current industry job and internship opportunities, register and
attend College of Computing events, network with students across the nation, and request appointments with a
Career Advisor. Newly-matriculated students may not be able to access Handshake until a couple of weeks after
the semester begins.
Career coaching can be provided by reaching out to the Educational Outreach Manager, Troy Peace
(tpeace@cc.gatech.edu). We also recommend that you contact your undergraduate and/or former graduate
school for alumni services.
Finally, OMSCS students have access to services for graduate students offered by the Career Center at Georgia
Tech. The Career Center offers workshops on many of the topics listed above, a job board that lists internships
and full-time jobs, and career fairs. The platform that is used within the Career Center is CareerBuzz, where you
can explore all of the services and events that are offered by the Career Center. All OMSCS students are granted
access to the platform once they formally enroll in classes."
Institute Services & Course-Related Resources,14,Can OMSCS students participate in the on-campus and virtual Georgia Tech career fairs?,"OMSCS students are eligible to participate in the on-campus and virtual College of Computing career fairs and
the Georgia Tech Career Center. Please note that BuzzCards are required for the on-campus career fairs."
Institute Services & Course-Related Resources,15,How do I find out more information about the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program?,"OMSCS students who are interested in participating in the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program should
contact that department directly. Their contact information can be found on their website. If you receive approval
from their program to participate, please keep the following in mind:
●
The courses can only be counted toward your MSCS degree as “free” elective credit. You may not count
these courses to fulfill any specialization requirements.
●
Since the course in which you would enroll has the “VIP” prefix, this will count toward the six-hour
maximum of non-CS/CSE and/or 4000-level courses that MSCS students can apply toward their degree.
●
The credit you earn for the VIP program does not count as a foundational course for the OMSCS
program. Therefore, you are still required to fulfill your foundational requirement by your designated
deadline, if you have not done so already.
●
If you have any additional questions regarding the VIP program, please contact their office directly, as the
OMSCS advisors are unable to provide specific information regarding that program or its requirements."
Institute Services & Course-Related Resources,16,Is the OMSCS program accredited?,"Georgia Tech’s undergraduate programs are ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology)

Deferring Admission"
Deferring Admission,1,"If I am not able to attend during the term I was admitted, what are my options?","It may be possible to defer your admission if you do not matriculate into the OMSCS program. Applications are
good for one year from the term for which you applied originally. For example, if you originally applied for the
Spring 2024 term, and you did not enroll in any classes/matriculate, it may be possible to request a deferral for the
Fall 2024 OR Spring 2025 term. If you want to matriculate after Spring 2025, you would need to reapply to the
OMSCS program.
Please note that deferral requests can be processed only for the fall and spring semesters.
Also, per the new Office of Graduate Education policy, an admitted applicant may only defer their
admission one time during the one-year timeframe that an application is valid.
In order to request to defer your admission, please send an email to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu from the
personal email address listed on your application. In the subject line, please include the phrase “Deferral
Request”, your full name, and your nine-digit gtID number (90XXXXXXX), replacing the first two digits with “xx”.
In your email, please include your original application term and the term to which you would like to defer your
admission.
○
If you would like to defer to the Fall 2024 semester, please send your deferral request after February 1, 2024
but before May 1, 2024 ○ If you would like to defer to the Spring 2025 semester, please send your deferral request after September 1,
2024 but before October 1, 2024
**It is best to submit your deferral request earlier rather than later during the designated time frame to allow enough time for processing both within the College of Computing and the Office of Graduate
Education.**
For students who are required to complete an English proficiency exam, please note that those scores are only
valid for two years from the date taken. For more information regarding English proficiency scores, please visit
the Office of Graduate Education’s website.

Deferring Admission,2,What does it mean to matriculate into the OMSCS program?,"When students register for a course(s) during their first semester in the program and remain enrolled after the
Phase II registration period has ended, they will have a record of enrollment for the semester and will be
considered a matriculated (current) student. This is true even if a student later decides to withdraw from a course
by the semester’s deadline, as the “W” on the transcript will still count as a record of enrollment for the semester.
Students are not considered matriculated (current) students if they register for a course(s) during their first
semester in the program but then drop their schedule before the Phase II registration period has ended."
Deferring Admission,3,How do I know if I need to submit a deferral request?,"Please note the following when determining whether a deferral request needs to be submitted:
●
If a student registers and remains enrolled after Phase II registration has ended, they are considered a
matriculated (current) OMSCS student and do not need to request to defer their admission, even if they
withdraw from a course in their first semester.
●
If a student registers but drops their schedule before Phase II registration has ended, they are not
considered a matriculated (current) OMSCS student and must submit a request to defer their admission
within the designated time frame, as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. Please review the
previous FAQs for more details.
○
Note: If your schedule is cancelled for nonpayment, you will NOT have a record of enrollment for
the semester. Therefore, if this is your first semester in the OMSCS program, you will need to
defer your admission, if you are eligible to do so."
Deferring Admission,4,"If I am planning to defer my admission, what do I need to do?","If you are planning to defer your admission, there is nothing you need to do except not register for courses that
term. You simply will need to follow up with our office to request a deferral during the time frame noted above. As
a reminder, it is best to submit your deferral request earlier rather than later during the designated time frame to
allow enough time for processing both within the College of Computing and the Office of Graduate Education.
Please keep in mind that registering for and later withdrawing from a course (which results in a “W” on your
transcript) means you are no longer eligible to defer your admission, as you are considered a matriculated
(current) student."
Deferring Admission,5,How many times am I permitted to defer my admission?,"As per the new Office of Graduate Education policy, an admitted applicant may only defer their admission one
time during the one-year timeframe that an application is valid.
To clarify further, if your original application term is Spring 2024, you can defer to Fall 2024 or to Spring 2025 –
you may not defer to Fall 2024 and then later request to defer to Spring 2025. If you deferred to Fall 2024 or Spring 2025 and did not matriculate, you would be required to submit a new application and be offered admission
again to be permitted to matriculate as an OMSCS student."
Deferring Admission,6,Why do I need to submit my deferral request after registration has ended and the semester has started?,"Due to the number of admitted students the College of Computing and the Office of Graduate Education are
supporting at the start of the semester during Phase II registration, deferral requests are not processed until after
the registration period has ended and the semester has started. Additionally, there have been times when
admitted students request for their admission to be deferred, and then their circumstances change, and they
decide that they do want to enroll for their original admit term. Therefore, the College of Computing and the Office
of Graduate Education do not start processing deferral requests until the time frames noted above."
Deferring Admission,7,"I am scheduled to matriculate this semester, but I cannot enroll for the course I want because the course is full. Can I defer my admission to the next term so that I can enroll in the specific course I want?","
If you are considering deferring your admission only because you cannot enroll in the specific course(s) you wish
to take, we strongly do not recommend pursuing the deferral, as you will be in the same situation the next term
since new students do not register until Phase II."
Deferring Admission,8,"If I defer my admission, when does my one-year time frame start for my foundational requirement?","If you do not matriculate, and you defer your admission to a future term, then your foundational requirement time
frame would start with your new matriculation term. For example, if you were admitted for Spring 2024 but did not
matriculate until Fall 2024, you would have the Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025 terms to fulfill the

foundational requirement.
However, please remember that if you matriculate into the program, your foundational requirement time frame
would begin, even if you withdraw from a course that term (since a “W” counts as a record of enrollment). For
example, if you matriculated into the program as of Spring 2024 and later withdrew, that term (Spring 2024) still
would count toward your foundational requirement time frame."
Deferring Admission,9,"I deferred my admission (or I am planning to defer my admission) and received a message indicating that my accounts are being inactivated. Can they remain active even though I am not a currently-enrolled
student since I plan to enroll in a future term?","If you are not enrolled and are not classified as a student who is eligible to enroll, your student-related services
will be discontinued. It is our understanding that OIT will not extend these student-related services until you are
eligible to enroll. For example, if you were admitted for Spring 2024 but deferred your admission to Fall 2024, you
would not have access to your accounts during the Spring 2024 semester but would regain access as the Fall
2024 semester approached."
Deferring Admission,10,"I submitted a deferral request, but now I am being informed that I will be losing access to my GT accounts, including email. How will you communicate with me?","
As noted previously, if you are not enrolled and are not classified as a student who is eligible to enroll, your
student-related services will be discontinued. Therefore, we will communicate with you using the personal email
account you listed on your application. Additionally, you may submit your deferral request from this personal
email account – your request does not need to be submitted from your GT email account."
Deferring Admission,11,Why am I still receiving registration-related emails if I am deferring my admission?,"Since deferral requests are not processed until after the semester starts, you most likely will continue to receive
registration-related emails as an admitted student for the term. If you wish to be removed from that semester’s
new-student mailing list, please send a message to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu. Please include your full name
and your nine-digit gtID number (90XXXXXXX), replacing the first two digits with “xx”.
Degree Requirements"
Degree Requirements,1,What are the degree requirements for the OMSCS program?,"The OMSCS degree requires 30 hours (10 courses). Students must declare one specialization, which, depending
on the specialization, is 15-18 hours (5-6 courses). The remaining 12-15 hours (4-5 courses) are “free” electives
and can be any courses offered through the OMSCS program. You can review the degree requirements online.
The requirements for each specialization can be found online as well. Please note that courses listed in bold
have been produced for the OMSCS program.
To be able to continue in the program after the first 12 months from your date of matriculation, you must complete
the foundational requirement of two foundational courses with a grade of “B” or better. You may choose a
foundational course that counts towards any area of your degree, whether a specialization requirement or a ""free""
elective. The courses that constitute “foundational courses” are designated with an asterisk (*) on the current
courses page of our website."
Degree Requirements,2,"By when do I need to declare my specialization, and how can I do so? Can I change my specialization once I declare it?","
We strongly recommend that you declare your specialization after your first two semesters in the program or as
soon as you have an idea as to which specialization you plan to pursue. Your specialization needs to be declared
by the time you apply to graduate. Please note that you are not “locked in” once you declare your specialization.
You may change your specialization any time that does not conflict with an active period of registration.
To declare your specialization, please follow these instructions:

**Please note that if you are receiving GI Bill benefits, the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) regulates that only
degree-applicable courses for your major are allowed to be certified for tuition and fee funding. This particular
student population is permitted no more than two semesters to declare a specialization. By declaring your
specialization, this will allow Georgia Tech’s Veteran’s Services office to certify your courses each semester.
Please contact the Veteran's Services office directly with any questions you may have regarding this requirement.
Their contact information can be found on their website."
Degree Requirements,3,Can I declare more than one specialization?,"No – students may declare only one specialization. However, you may take courses beyond your specialization
as “free” electives."
Degree Requirements,4,Can I use extra specialization core courses as specialization electives (and vice versa)?,"For the most part, if students take extra specialization core courses and/or extra specialization elective courses
beyond what is required in their specialization, the extra course(s) can be used only towards the ""free"" electives.
In other words, specialization core courses cannot be used towards the specialization elective requirements and
vice versa (specialization elective courses cannot be used towards the specialization core requirements).
The only exception is for students pursuing the Computing Systems specialization. Please visit the
specialization’s webpage for more information regarding what can be accepted."
Degree Requirements,5,Am I allowed to make substitutions within the OMSCS degree requirements?,"The official College policy is that substitutions for specialization coursework are made only when necessary when
specialization courses are not available. Since all five of the specializations offered through the OMSCS program
can be completed without substitutions, no substitutions will be approved."
Degree Requirements,6,Am I allowed to audit a course or take it on the pass/fail grading basis?,"Students are permitted to earn only a letter grade in all OMSCS courses. Students may not audit an OMSCS
course or take it on the pass/fail grading basis.
The only exception is the CS 8001 one-hour seminars. As a reminder, these seminars are graded on the pass/fail
grading basis and will NOT count toward your graduation requirements."
Degree Requirements,7,How long do I have to complete the program and earn my degree?,Students must complete the OMSCS degree in six years as per the Institute’s policy.
Degree Requirements,8,What happens if I need more than six years to complete the program?,"Any coursework that is older than six years needs to be approved by the Graduate Curriculum Committee (GCC)
and the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee (IGCC) in order to be applied to your degree. If you will be
exceeding the six-year time frame, please be sure to contact oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu the semester before

Degree Requirements,9,Can I count non-CS/CSE courses and/or previously-completed undergraduate-level courses toward my MSCS degree?,"
As per the program rules, a maximum of six hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code
other than CS or CSE. If you have any questions, especially regarding previously-completed undergraduate-level

coursework requirement of 2 courses in the program with a grade of B or better.” Will I be notified when I
am fully admitted into the OMSCS program?","As stated previously, to be able to continue in the program after the first 12 months from your date of
matriculation, you must complete a foundational coursework requirement of two foundational courses with a grade
of “B” or better. The courses that constitute “foundational courses” are designated with an asterisk (*) on this
webpage.
We do not send notifications for students who have completed their foundational requirement. If you would like to
verify that you have completed your foundational requirement, please refer to the link above to determine if the
courses you have completed successfully are considered to be foundational courses."
Foundational Requirement,2,Do my foundational courses have to be a part of my intended/declared specialization?,"No — you may choose a foundational course that counts towards any area of your degree, whether a
specialization requirement or a ""free"" elective."
Foundational Requirement,3,"Can I register for non-foundational courses for a future term if I am on track to finish the foundational requirement by the end of this term (either I am enrolled in two foundational courses, or I am enrolled in
my second foundational course)?","If you are enrolled in two foundational courses or your second foundational course, you would not be eligible to
enroll in any non-foundational courses until you successfully completed the two foundational course(s) with a ""B""
or better.
To clarify, during Phase I registration, you would be restricted to enrolling only in foundational courses. If you
successfully completed the requirement by the end of the current term, the restriction would be lifted shortly after
grades had been posted, and you would have an opportunity to make adjustments to your future schedule during
Phase II."
Foundational Requirement,4,What happens if I do not meet my foundational requirement by my designated deadline?,"As of now, students have not been dismissed from the OMSCS program simply for not fulfilling the foundational
requirement. Students will need to continue enrolling in foundational courses until they have satisfied this
requirement. Our office sends an email each semester for students whose foundational requirement deadline has
passed, so please refer to these messages for any updated information regarding this policy.
Course/Program Planning"
Course/Program Planning,1,Which semesters are OMSCS courses offered?,"OMSCS courses are offered during the spring, summer, and fall semesters. However, the summer offerings are
much more limited due to the condensed time frame of the semester. Students are not required to enroll in each
term consecutively, but please make note of the readmission policy if you plan not to enroll during a specific

semester(s) (please see the “Taking Time Off” section in the FAQs for more information)."
Course/Program Planning,2,"For the summer semester, are OMSCS courses offered as part of the “Early Short Summer” or “Late Short Summer” schedule?","
All OMSCS summer courses are “Full Summer” courses. Our program does not offer any “Early Short Summer”
or “Late Short Summer” courses."
Course/Program Planning,3,Are there plans to add more courses and/or specializations to the OMSCS program?,"At this time, all of the courses/specializations that will be offered with the OMSCS program are listed on our
website. The advisors unfortunately do not have any additional information other than the information that is
posted on our website."
Course/Program Planning,4,Can I take on-campus and/or Distance Learning (DL) courses as an OMSCS student?,"Unfortunately, OMSCS students are not eligible to enroll in on-campus or DL courses, as they are considered to
be a different campus and have different tuition rates/fees. Likewise, on-campus or DL students are not eligible to
enroll in OMSCS courses."
Course/Program Planning,5,Can I enroll in courses offered through the OMS Analytics and/or OMS Cybersecurity programs as an OMSCS student?,"
Sections for OMSCS students have been created for a select number of OMS Analytics and OMS Cybersecurity
courses. If a section of an OMS Analytics or OMS Cybersecurity course has been created for OMSCS students, it
will have a section of “O” followed by a two-digit number (example: O01, O02, O03, etc.). As a reminder, courses
designated with the “OAN” section are reserved for OMS Analytics students, and courses designated with the
“OCY” section are reserved for OMS Cybersecurity students. Therefore, please be sure you are selecting the
correct section if you wish to enroll in the course.
***Please remember that per the program rules:
""A maximum of six hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code other than CS or CSE.”***
If you have questions about the OMS Analytics program or courses offered through that program, please visit their
website. For the OMS Cybersecurity program and courses offered through that program, please visit their
website for more information."
Course/Program Planning,6,Are there prerequisites for the OMSCS program and/or courses?,"There are no official/enforced prerequisites for the OMSCS courses beyond those required for admission into the
program, so students can take these courses in essentially any order. There are certain recommendations as to
what material/information you should be familiar with prior to taking a course (available in the course descriptions
online), but there are no official prerequisites for the OMSCS courses.
In general we expect students who enter the program to be very comfortable working with multiple programming
languages such as C, Java, and Python (there is no provision within the program to make up any deficiencies)
and to have taken several more advanced topics, such as Advanced OS, Networking, Theory, and/or Algorithms.
More information about this can be found on our website.
If a student needs to take refresher courses before enrolling in OMSCS courses, it is up to the student to find out
how and where to take these kinds of courses, as OMSCS Advising cannot provide advisement for that. Again,
please refer to our website for more information."
Course/Program Planning,7,"After reading the course descriptions, it appears I am only prepared to take “X” course(s). What happens if I am not able to enroll in that specific course(s)?","
Since there are no official prerequisites for our courses (beyond those required for admission into the program),
there is an expectation that students should be prepared for essentially most, if not all, of the OMSCS courses.
Therefore, please do not contact OMSCS Advising requesting to be enrolled in a specific course based on your
qualifications, especially since the advisors are unable to add students to courses and/or wait lists.

18"
Course/Program Planning,8,Can my advisor help me plan out all of my courses in advance?,"Unfortunately, advisors cannot register students for courses, nor can we add students to wait lists. Therefore, we
cannot guarantee that students will be able to take specific courses during specific semesters, so planning out the
exact ten courses you wish to take (and the semester you wish to take them) most likely is not possible, as
students should plan to be flexible in taking courses whenever they are available.
As a reminder, there are no official/enforced prerequisites for the OMSCS courses (beyond those required for
admission into the program), so students can take these classes in essentially any order. There are certain
recommendations as to what material/information you should be familiar with prior to taking a course, but there
are no official prerequisites for the OMSCS courses. For course-specific prerequisite information, please read the
course descriptions online. Please refer to the FAQ below (#10) for more information on how to plan for future
courses using DegreeWorks."
Course/Program Planning,9,Do I need to take courses in the order they are listed on the specialization webpages?,"No, as mentioned previously, students can take OMSCS courses in essentially any order. Students are not
required to take their specialization courses (or any courses) in a specific order."
Course/Program Planning,10,How can I check my degree progress and/or plan for future courses?,"To check your degree progress and/or plan for future courses, we encourage you to use DegreeWorks. If you
have declared your specialization, DegreeWorks should tell you what requirements, if any, you are missing. It
also should allow you to plan for future courses using the “what if” feature. If you have not yet declared your
specialization, all of your courses should be listed in the ""Fallthrough Section"", as they will not be allocated until
you declare your specialization. Please note that specializations cannot be declared during active periods of
registration. As a reminder, please be sure to review the degree requirements and the specialization
requirements. Alternatively, you can print a degree worksheet for your specialization and fill it in so that you can
see what requirements, if any, are remaining. You may access the degree worksheets online."
Course/Program Planning,11,"There have been some curriculum changes (new course numbers, recently-approved specialization courses, etc.), and my DegreeWorks is not listing these courses in the correct areas of my degree audit.
When will this be adjusted?","If changes are made to the curriculum or a new course number is assigned after you have matriculated,
DegreeWorks will not make the necessary adjustments automatically – the OMSCS advisors have to make
exceptions in DegreeWorks manually. This typically is not done until students have petitioned to graduate, though
you are welcome to contact our office at oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu, and we would be happy to make the
change ahead of time, as long as you already successfully completed the course(s). Please note that we will not
be able to make changes to courses that are still in progress, as we need to ensure that the minimum grade is
earned before making the change in DegreeWorks."
Course/Program Planning,12,Why are my non-CS/CSE courses not being applied to my degree requirements in DegreeWorks?,"Since these courses are outside of the CS/CSE curriculum, your OMSCS advisor will need to manually apply any
non-CS/CSE coursework to your record in DegreeWorks. This typically is not done until students have petitioned
to graduate, though you are welcome to contact our office at oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu, and we would be
happy to make the change ahead of time, as long as you already successfully completed the course(s). Please
note that we will not be able to make changes to courses that are still in progress, as we need to ensure that the
minimum grade is earned before making the change in DegreeWorks."
Course/Program Planning,13,When will the course schedules for each term be available?,"The course schedules for each term are released shortly before the Phase I registration period for each term.
Please refer to the academic calendar for term-specific dates."
Course/Program Planning,14,I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Can I double-count any of my courses toward my OMSCS degree?,"
Students completing both a bachelor’s and master’s in the same discipline (Computer Science) at Georgia Tech
might be able to use up to six credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees.

To qualify for this option, students must complete the undergraduate degree with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or
higher and complete the master’s degree within a two-year period from the award date of the bachelor’s degree.
Please visit this website for more information. If you feel you qualify for this option, please send a message from
your GT email account to oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu and include your full name and nine-digit gtID number.
Your advisor will be able to assist you and confirm your eligibility."
Course/Program Planning,15,I earned another master’s degree at Georgia Tech prior to matriculating in the OMSCS program. Can I double-count any of my courses toward my OMSCS degree?,"
Students who have earned another master’s degree at Georgia Tech might be eligible to double-count up to six
hours of previously-earned credit toward their OMSCS degree. Please visit this website for more information
regarding this policy. If you feel you qualify for this, please send a message from your GT email account to
oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu and include your full name and nine-digit gtID number. Your advisor will be able to
assist you and confirm your eligibility."
Course/Program Planning,16,I took courses and/or earned another degree (undergraduate and/or graduate) from Georgia Tech – are there restrictions as to which OMSCS courses I can enroll in and count toward my OMSCS degree?,"
If you previously completed courses at Georgia Tech, specifically undergraduate and/or graduate Computer
Science (CS) or other CS-related undergraduate and/or graduate courses, you will be responsible for researching
whether the course(s) are considered to be “equivalent” to OMSCS courses, as these credits typically cannot
count toward your OMSCS degree if they were used toward another earned degree. Please refer to this website
for more information. Additionally, we have provided you with some of the equivalencies (please see the table
below), but we strongly recommend that you contact OMSCS Advising, as things can change and/or be updated
at any time.

Course/Program Planning,17,What is the difference between when two courses are cross-listed and when they are considered to be equivalent?,"
Equivalent courses are courses that are listed as equivalent in Banner. They may not necessarily be taught
together (such as the Atlanta campus courses CS 4460 and CS 6730). Cross-listed courses are courses that are

taught together and are usually equivalents as well (such as CS 4641 and CS 7641)."
Course/Program Planning,18,Are there any courses that students cannot count toward their MSCS degree?,"MSCS students are not permitted to count credit for 1) CSE 6010 Computational Problem Solving for Scientists
and Engineers; 2) CSE 6040 Computing for Data Analysis: Methods and Tools; 3) CS 4001 Computing, Society
and Professionalism; or 4) CS 4002 Robots and Society toward their MSCS degree.
Additionally, the CS 8001 one-hour seminars will NOT count toward your graduation requirements.
If you have concerns about other courses, please be sure to contact your OMSCS advisor from your GT email
account at oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu. Please include your full name and your nine-digit gtID number
(90XXXXXXX), replacing the first two digits with “xx”.
Grades/GPA Requirement"
Grades/GPA Requirement,1,"Is it possible to repeat a course, and what are the consequences of doing so?","According to the academic catalog, “Students may not repeat courses on a letter-grade basis in which the grade
of ‘B’ or higher has been earned previously.”
In other cases of a repeated course, we will consider the newest grade for purposes of completing a requirement
(specialization and/or foundational course); however, you can never have the initial grade replaced or removed
from your GPA, unless you are eligible to pursue the grade substitution policy as noted below.
Please also note that if you retake a course, it can be used to satisfy only one requirement, as one course cannot
be used to satisfy more than one requirement.
If you withdraw from a course, “W”s are visible on your transcript, but they have no impact on your GPA. If you
retake a course from which you previously have withdrawn, the “W” from your first attempt and the new grade
from that class both will appear on your transcript."
Grades/GPA Requirement,2,What are the grade/GPA requirements to remain active in the program?,"Please visit http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/6/ and https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/academic-standing and
review this information carefully. Please note that your academic standing is based on your cumulative GPA
and/or your term GPA. For MS students, the minimum GPA to remain in good academic standing is 27. However, please note that you must earn a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher in order to meet the graduation requirements. For information on how to calculate your GPA, please refer to the Registrar’s website."
Grades/GPA Requirement,3,Does the grade substitution policy apply to graduate students?,"A grade substitution policy has been approved for graduate students. Please visit
https://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/5/ and https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/applying-for-graduate-grade-substitution
for information regarding eligibility."
Grades/GPA Requirement,4,How do OMSCS students apply for a graduate grade substitution?,"The grade substitution form is available on the Registrar’s Office’s website and must be completed via DocuSign
by the established deadline. Please be sure to use your advisor’s direct email address (NOT
oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) when submitting this form."
Grades/GPA Requirement,5,When does the graduate grade substitution policy take effect?,The new policy takes effect starting with the Summer 2022 semester under the 2022-2023 academic catalog.
Grades/GPA Requirement,6,Is the graduate grade substitution policy retroactive?,"No, the policy is not retroactive. The “C”, “D”, or “F” grade to be substituted must have been earned in a course
taken during or after the Summer 2022 semester. The new policy does NOT apply to courses taken prior to
Summer 2022 Click here to return to Table of Contents 23"
Grades/GPA Requirement,7,Is academic standing impacted/recalculated retroactively once the graduate grade substitution has been applied to a student’s record?,"
Yes, a student’s academic standing would update once the grade substitution had been applied. For example, if a
student’s first attempt was during the Summer 2022 semester, and an unsatisfactory grade was earned, and then
the course was repeated successfully in Fall 2022, then the academic standing for Summer 2022 would be
updated (since the original grade would be excluded from the cumulative GPA) and would be built upon once the
grade substitution had been applied."
Grades/GPA Requirement,8,Will the grade substitution be visible on a transcript?,"Yes, the student’s transcript would show the original grade with a comment of “Excluded grade substitution”."
Grades/GPA Requirement,9,Is there a minimum grade that a student must earn to be approved for a grade substitution?,"Students do not have to earn a minimum grade to request a grade substitution. For example, a student could
earn a “D”, repeat the course and earn a “C”, and apply for a grade substitution."
Grades/GPA Requirement,10,"If students with undergraduate degrees from Georgia Tech have previously been approved for undergraduate grade substitutions, would they be permitted to apply for one at the graduate level?","
Yes, the grade substitution policy “resets” at the graduate level."
Grades/GPA Requirement,11,Does the graduate grade substitution policy impact BSMS students in any specific way?,"No, both the undergraduate and graduate grade substitution policies can be applied to BSMS students. When
they are BS students, they will follow the undergraduate grade substitution policy. When they matriculate into the
graduate level, they will then follow the graduate grade substitution policy."
Grades/GPA Requirement,12,"If undergraduate Georgia Tech students enroll in graduate-level GT courses, which grade substitution policy would be in effect (undergraduate or graduate)?","
The grade substitution policies are based on a student’s level (undergraduate or graduate), not the course level.
For example, if undergraduate students complete graduate-level courses, they will follow the undergraduate grade
substitution policy."
Grades/GPA Requirement,13,Are exceptions to the graduate grade substitution policy possible?,"The grade substitution policy (including, but not limited to, course eligibility, number of courses, time limits, and
deadlines) is not subject to exceptions."
Grades/GPA Requirement,14,Can the graduate grade substitution policy be petitioned to the Graduate Institute Curriculum Committee?,The graduate grade substitution policy may NOT be petitioned to the Graduate Institute Curriculum Committee.
Grades/GPA Requirement,15,Are OMSCS students required to opt into the graduate grade substitution policy in order to graduate?,"No, OMSCS students are NOT required to opt into the graduate grade substitution policy if they do not wish
to do so. OMSCS students are eligible for graduation if they are meeting all MSCS degree requirements,
even without opting into the graduate grade substitution policy."
Grades/GPA Requirement,16,"If I earn a “D” in a course, can it count toward my OMSCS degree?","Courses in which a student earns less than a “C” cannot be counted toward the OMSCS degree. Please note that
these grades still will be factored into your overall cumulative GPA and cannot be removed from your record,
unless you opt into the graduate grade substitution policy."
Grades/GPA Requirement,17,"If I do not earn the required grade in a course, or if I withdraw from a course, am I required to repeat the course in a later semester?","If the course is required for your specialization, and there are no other course options within that specific area of
your specialization that you can take instead (since substitutions are not permitted), then you must retake the
course and earn the required ""B"" or better for specialization/foundational courses. However, if there are other
course options available within that specific area for your specialization, then you may choose to enroll in a

different course to satisfy the requirement.
If the course would count as a “free” elective, you have the option of retaking it to earn the required “C” or better
for “free” electives, or you may choose to enroll in a different course to satisfy your “free” elective requirement."
Grades/GPA Requirement,18,Is there a limit to how many times I can withdraw from and/or repeat a course?,"There is no specific limit to how many times a student may take and later withdraw from and/or repeat a specific
course. However, please keep in mind the degree requirements outlined in this document and the academic
catalog, including the satisfactory academic progress requirements, the six-year requirement, and the graduate
grade substitution policy."
Grades/GPA Requirement,19,How is my academic standing impacted if I withdraw from or do not enroll in a semester?,"It is our understanding that if you withdraw from or do not enroll in a semester, and you do not have any new
grades that would change your status, then your academic standing from the previous semester would carry over.
Therefore, if you were on academic warning or academic probation after your last enrolled term, then this status
would carry over to the next term as long as you did not have any new grades to change your academic standing.
There is an exception to this, as it relates to making satisfactory academic progress in the program. As noted
above, if you are withdrawing semester after semester without successfully completing a course, your academic
standing in the program could be impacted."
Grades/GPA Requirement,20,"If I am on academic warning or academic probation, am I allowed to withdraw from a course/semester?","As long as you do not have a hold on your account, you should be able to withdraw from a course/semester, even
if you are on academic warning or academic probation. As stated previously, if you were to withdraw from the
semester, and you did not have any new grades that would change your status, then your academic standing from
the previous semester would carry over. Therefore, if you were on academic warning or academic probation after
your last enrolled term, and you did not have any new grades that would change your status, then your academic
standing would carry over to the next term.
There is an exception to this, as it relates to making satisfactory academic progress in the program. As noted
above, if you are withdrawing semester after semester without successfully completing a course, your academic
standing in the program could be impacted."
Grades/GPA Requirement,21,By when do I need to resolve an “I” grade?,"Detailed information regarding an “I” grade can be found in the following sections of the academic catalog:
●
Section C, Point 7
●
Section A
●
Section B, Point 1
To confirm: ""When a grade of ‘I’ (‘Incomplete') is assigned in a course, the ‘I' grade must be removed and the
grade change reported by the end of the student's next academic term in residence or, if the student has not been
enrolled, by the end of the academic term one calendar year from the date the incomplete was assigned. Failing
to remove the ‘I' in the allotted time will result in the grade of ‘I' being changed to the grade of ‘F'. To remove the
‘I' grade, the student should consult with the instructor as soon as possible after the academic term is over and
complete whatever remaining coursework is outlined by the instructor. Repeating the course for credit does not
remove the grade of ‘I’."""
Grades/GPA Requirement,22,Is it possible to “start over” or “erase” my previous academic history?,"Unfortunately, this is not possible. Your previous academic history always will be a part of your student
record, even if you take time off and seek readmission into the program at a later time.
Click here to return to Table of Contents
25"
Grades/GPA Requirement,23,"If I take extra OMSCS courses, can I designate which courses will count toward my “degree” GPA rather than my cumulative GPA?","
The OMSCS program does not have a separate “degree GPA” and simply uses your cumulative GPA. The only
exception to this is for students who continue taking courses after they have graduated from the OMSCS
program. For the purposes of your resume, whatever your GPA was when your degree was awarded would be
your MS GPA.
Registration-Related Information"
Registration-Related Information,1,What is the difference between Phase I and Phase II registration?,"Current/returning students will register during Phase I and will have another opportunity to make changes to their
schedules during Phase II. Newly-admitted students will register during Phase II only. For the summer term,
there is only one registration phase, with an “unofficial” Phase II period taking place shortly before the start of the
semester. Visit the academic calendar for term-specific dates."
Registration-Related Information,2,Are the published times/deadlines updated based on my local time zone if I do not live in Atlanta?,"No — all of the Institute times/deadlines you see are listed in the Eastern time zone. They will not update
automatically to reflect your local time zone. Therefore, you will need to be mindful of time-sensitive
activities/deadlines such as when time tickets open, the expiration of a wait list notification, the end of a
registration period, the semester’s withdrawal deadline, etc. For any class-specific deadline, please be sure to
work with your instructor and/or TA(s)."
Registration-Related Information,3,What is the maximum number of courses I can register for each term?,"The OMSCS program is a part-time program only – no exceptions will be made to allow for full-time enrollment.
Students can register for a maximum of seven hours during the fall and spring semesters, and students are
limited to enrolling in five hours during the summer semester. Please note that Financial Aid and other programs
may have specific credit hour requirements, so be sure to follow up with their office(s) directly for more
information."
Registration-Related Information,4,What if a course I want to register for is CLOSED?,"Once the registration cap has been reached for a course, the course is full. In order to request a seat in a closed
course, you must follow the instructions in SECTION G. WAITLISTING FOR A CLOSED COURSE. The OMSCS
program does not accept override requests. Please note that OMSCS Advising cannot register students for
classes, nor can we add students to wait lists."
Registration-Related Information,5,What if the wait list for a course I want to register for is CLOSED?,"If the wait list is full/closed when you are attempting to add yourself, please check back later. Students remove
themselves from wait lists, and seats are added to courses (which removes students from the wait list), so there is
a strong chance that a spot will become available at a later time."
Registration-Related Information,6,Why is there a limit on the number of seats for each course if this is an online program?,"While we do not have physical space constraints, there are other factors that have to be taken into consideration
for an online program this size. One example is that in order to maintain the integrity and academic rigor of the
program, we have to hire an adequate number of TAs per a specific number of enrolled students. This is why we
limit the number of waitlisted courses for each student so that we have a realistic idea of the demand for each
course and can hire TAs accordingly (whenever possible). Additionally, some courses are unable to scale above
a certain maximum while still providing an effective learning experience for students."
Registration-Related Information,7,Can OMSCS Advising tell me which courses are open currently?,"Students can access up-to-date enrollment and wait list totals by performing a class search in OSCAR. You can
perform a course look-up in OSCAR once you have logged in using your GT credentials — the full courses have a
“C” in the first column, and the open courses have a checkbox that can be selected in order to enroll."
Registration-Related Information,8,What are the chances of enrolling in a class if I am waitlisted or if the class is closed?,"We strive to give students an opportunity to register for a variety of courses. The number of available seats is
determined primarily by the number of TAs available for each course. Unfortunately, advisors cannot predict
if/when a course may have more seats added or if a wait list will be expanded. Also, we cannot guarantee
students will be able to enroll in specific courses. Our best advice is to continue monitoring the courses you are
interested in taking and/or the wait lists. Towards the end of Phase II, the wait lists will be removed, and you may

have another opportunity to register for your desired course(s). More information regarding this will be
forthcoming. Alternatively, you may review the degree requirements and try to find another course."
Registration-Related Information,9,Why am I receiving an error message if I can see available seats when attempting to register?,"If there are seats available in the course, but the course has a wait list, you will receive an error message when
attempting to register. This is because the seats that are available are reserved for the students on the wait list.
Therefore, students cannot bypass the wait list and enroll in a course – they must add themselves to the wait list,
if there are spaces available."
Registration-Related Information,10,How long should I expect to wait before I receive a wait list notification?,"There is no specific amount of time as to when students will receive a wait list notification, as we unfortunately
cannot guarantee that everyone on every wait list will get into the course. As stated previously, some courses are
unable to scale above a certain maximum while still providing an effective learning experience for students.
Please note that the advisors are unable to determine/predict which courses will have more seats added.
Therefore, please be sure to monitor your email account carefully and frequently, including your spam folder, in
case you receive a wait list notification."
Registration-Related Information,11,Can I use a computer program or script when trying to register for courses?,"As explained on the Registrar’s website, “Students are required to abide by the Institute's Acceptable Use Policy
when using Georgia Tech's computer resources, including the registration system. As such, no student may use
any unauthorized computer program or script to register for classes or attempt to circumvent the registration
system in any way. No student should repeatedly attempt to register for a closed section of a course by hand in
an attempt to ""brute force"" into the next available seat. To do so is a violation, as ‘faculty, staff, and students are
expected to behave in an ethical and professional manner when using IT resources.’ This also violates the
section ‘Protection of IT Resources’ by ‘knowingly installing or running...disruptive software’ which results in
depriving other students an opportunity to register. Information regarding any student who violates this policy will
be forwarded to the Dean of Students for disciplinary action.”"
Registration-Related Information,12,Why is my wait list position increasing instead of decreasing?,"Each semester, we prioritize the degree candidates on wait lists if they need a specific specialization course (not
“free” elective) to graduate by the end of the term. Therefore, your wait list position could change due to degree
candidates receiving priority. We hope that students will understand this, as we will do the same for you once you
are in your final term and are preparing to graduate."
Registration-Related Information,13,Why is my waitlisted course showing as “0” credits in OSCAR?,"Since a waitlisted course does not count as enrolled hours, your waitlisted course will display as “0” units until you
are registered officially (though please remember that being on a wait list does not guarantee that you will be
permitted to enroll in that course for the term)."
Registration-Related Information,14,"If I am registered for the maximum number of hours permitted, and I receive a wait list notification, will I be able to drop one of my other courses in order to add the waitlisted course, or will the system skip me
and notify the next person on the wait list?","The system will not skip you because you are enrolled in the maximum number of hours permitted. You will have
the same 12-hour window to respond to the wait list notification and make any necessary changes to your
schedule in order to enroll in the waitlisted course if desired."
Registration-Related Information,15,I missed my wait list notification. What should I do now?,"Unfortunately, the only thing you can do is add yourself back to the wait list and hope for the best or select
another course. The OMSCS program must abide by the Institute’s policies and procedures, and this includes the
fact that wait list notifications can be sent at any time (even overnight and/or on weekends) and that students
have 12 hours to respond to the notification. The wait list process is not controlled by OMSCS Advising, so we
are unable to make any changes or exceptions regarding this process."
Registration-Related Information,16,I received a “Campus Restriction” or “Major Restriction” error message when trying to add a course. What does this mean?,"
If you receive the “Campus Restriction” or “Major Restriction” error message, this is because you are attempting
to enroll in a course that is not part of the OMSCS program. As a reminder, most OMSCS courses will have a
section of “O” followed by a two-digit number (example: O01, O02, O03, etc.).
Please note that courses with the “OAN” section are for OMS Analytics students only, and courses with

the “OCY” section are for OMS Cybersecurity students only – OMSCS students are NOT permitted to
enroll in these sections.
If a section of an OMS Analytics or OMS Cybersecurity course has been created for OMSCS students, it will have
a section of “O” followed by a two-digit number (as mentioned previously). Therefore, please be sure you are
selecting the correct section if you wish to enroll in the course.
***Please remember that per the program rules:
""A maximum of six hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code other than CS or CSE.”***"
Registration-Related Information,17,What is the difference between “L” and “ALP” in the “BAS” column in OSCAR?,"When searching for courses in OSCAR, the “BAS” column tells you the grade modes accepted for a particular
course. OMSCS courses have the “L” grading basis, which stands for “Letter Grade”, as students may not audit
an OMSCS course or take it on the “Pass/Fail” grading basis.
The one exception are the CS 8001 seminars, as those are graded on the “Pass/Fail” grading basis. As a
reminder, these will NOT count toward your graduation requirements.
You might notice that other courses, such as those offered through the OMS Analytics and OMS Cybersecurity
programs, have the “ALP” grading basis, which stands for “Audit”, “Letter Grade”, and “Pass/Fail”. As a reminder,
courses with the “OAN” section are for OMS Analytics students only, and courses with the “OCY” section are for
OMS Cybersecurity students only – OMSCS students are NOT permitted to enroll in these sections. If a section
of an OMS Analytics or OMS Cybersecurity course has been created for OMSCS students, it will have a section
of “O” followed by a two-digit number as described above. Again, please be sure you are selecting the correct
section if you wish to enroll in the course.
***Please remember that per the program rules:
""A maximum of six hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code other than CS or CSE.”***"
Registration-Related Information,18,What happens if I am not able to register for my course until the first week of classes?,"Professors have access in Canvas to see when students were added to their course. It is our understanding that
students will not be penalized for assignments that were due before the student was registered for the course.
However, please be sure to confirm this with your professor(s) and/or TAs, and please contact them for any other
specific questions you may have regarding their course and/or assignments."
Registration-Related Information,19,What happens if I am not registered by the time Phase II registration has ended?,"Unfortunately, students cannot be added to a course(s) once Phase II registration has ended. Therefore, if you
plan to be enrolled in that specific term, you may need to enroll in a backup course prior to the end of the active
registration period if your first-choice course is not available."
Registration-Related Information,20,"If I am still on the wait list toward the end of the Phase II registration period, will my wait list position carry over to the next semester’s registration period?","
On the last day of Phase II registration, all of the wait lists are cleared, and students are able to enroll in any open
course without needing to go through the wait list first. Therefore, wait lists will not carry over to the next
semester’s registration period."
Registration-Related Information,21,"If there are seats available once Phase II registration has ended, can I be added to the course?","Students cannot be added to a course(s) once Phase II registration has ended, even if there are seats available."
Registration-Related Information,22,I successfully registered for a course. What should I do next?,"Once you have successfully registered for a course, you should log into Canvas to see if you have access to the
course materials. Please see the next FAQ in case you do not see your course materials once you are registered
for the course.

Registration-Related Information,23,"Classes have started, and I cannot access my course materials and/or Canvas has not been set up for my course. Is this normal?","course. Is this normal?
As stated previously, course materials will be available sometime during the first week of classes. Unfortunately,
we do not have control over when course materials will be available, nor do we have any additional information as
to exactly when course materials will be available. Please note that some professors do not start their classes
until later in the week, so you may not be able to view any course materials even if the semester technically has
started already.
If you register for a course during the first week that classes begin, please note that it can take up to 24 hours
before you can access your course materials. If after this period of time you still cannot access your course
materials, please contact canvas@gatech.edu for Canvas access."
Registration-Related Information,24,"I successfully registered for a course, but Canvas is showing a different course prefix than what is displayed in OSCAR. How do I know if I registered for the correct section?","displayed in OSCAR. How do I know if I registered for the correct section?
Instructors have the ability to edit the “display title” for a course in Canvas. Therefore, when crosslisted sections
of different courses are being taught together, students may encounter times where the course prefix in Canvas is
different than the one listed in OSCAR. For registration/degree-completion purposes, we will rely on your course
registration according to Banner, not Canvas."
Registration-Related Information,25,Can I be switched to another course once the registration period has ended?,"No – unfortunately, even if there are seats available, you cannot be switched to another course once the
registration period has ended. If you no longer wish to be enrolled in the course, you will need to withdraw before
the semester’s withdrawal deadline."
Registration-Related Information,26,What is the difference between dropping and withdrawing from a course?,"When a student drops a course, this action can only be done during active periods of registration (either in Phase
I and/or Phase II). If a student drops a course, the course will not be reflected on their transcript. It will appear as
if the student never registered for the course, according to their transcript. This means that the student will not
have a record of enrollment for the term.
If a student withdraws from a course (this is done after Phase II registration has ended and before the
semester’s withdrawal deadline), this action will result in a “W” on the student’s transcript. If a student withdraws
from a course (or courses) and receives a “W” on the transcript, this counts as a record of enrollment for that
specific term."
Registration-Related Information,27,"If I withdraw from a course and change my mind, can I be re-added to the course?","No – unfortunately, students cannot be re-added to a course once they have withdrawn. Please keep this in mind
as you are deciding whether or not you wish to withdraw from the course (before the withdrawal deadline)."
Registration-Related Information,28,"If I withdraw from a course/semester, do I need to submit a Petition to the Faculty form to enroll the next semester?","No – as per Georgia Tech’s readmission policy, “With the exception of part-time graduate students, any student
who withdraws during a term and wishes to return the following term must complete a Petition to the Faculty Form
only.” Therefore, since OMSCS students are part-time graduate students, you do not need to submit a ""Petition
to the Faculty” form if you withdraw.
Please keep in mind the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy as noted above when considering withdrawing
from the semester."
Registration-Related Information,29,"If I have an open OSI investigation for a course, or if I was found “responsible” at the conclusion of an OSI investigation for a course, am I permitted to withdraw or submit a Petition to the Faculty for a late
withdrawal?","OSI investigation for a course, am I permitted to withdraw or submit a Petition to the Faculty for a late
withdrawal?
Per the Registrar’s website: “If there is an alleged academic integrity violation pending, the student may not drop
the course. The status of the alleged violation is defined as ‘pending’ when an incident has been submitted to the
Office of Student Integrity and has generated an electronic ‘suspected academic misconduct’ notice that has been
sent to the student. If the student is found responsible for any prohibited academic conduct, she/he will not be

allowed to drop the course.”
Additionally: “If the student is found responsible for any prohibited academic conduct in a class, she/he will also
not be allowed to withdraw from the term.”
Finally, a course is not eligible for grade substitution if the student was found responsible for any academic
misconduct in that course, regardless of how many times it is repeated.
Please contact the Registrar’s Office and the Office of Student Integrity if you have any questions regarding this."
Registration-Related Information,30,Will I retain access to my course materials in Canvas after completing a course?,"This is at the discretion of the course instructor. We recommend that students check with the course’s teaching
team during the semester in which you are enrolled so that you can plan accordingly.

Payments & Financial Information,10,Who should I contact if I have questions regarding refunds and/or refund eligibility?,"Please contact the Bursar’s Office for more information regarding refunds. Keep in mind that you will receive NO
refund if you are enrolled for more than one class and withdraw from only one course. You only are eligible for a
partial refund if you completely withdraw from school (withdraw from ALL of your courses for the current term).
Taking Time Off"
Taking Time Off,1,Can I take a semester off?,"OMSCS students may take up to two consecutive semesters off at any time after they have matriculated into the
OMSCS program. However, if you take three or more consecutive semesters off, you must apply for readmission.
Please note that the summer term counts as one of the consecutive semesters, even though students are not
required to enroll in the summer term. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee you will be readmitted. For more
information, please review the Registrar's Readmission Policy.
To clarify, if a student enrolls in a course and withdraws (which would result in a “W” on the student’s transcript),
this counts as a record of enrollment for that semester and does not count as sitting out for the semester.
Therefore, the student would need to sit out the next three consecutive semesters before needing to apply for
readmission. If a student drops a course, this does not count as a record of enrollment, and this would be
considered as sitting out a semester.
Please see the FAQ section entitled “Registration-Related Information” for a detailed explanation of the
difference between dropping and withdrawing from a course.
Please note: If you are a newly-admitted student and are not planning to attend your first semester, you will need
to submit a request to defer your admission. Please refer to the “Deferring Admission” section of the FAQ for
more information about how and when to submit this request."
Taking Time Off,2,What is the process once students seek readmission?,"Students must complete the step-by-step instructions on the Registrar’s readmission website. After they have
successfully submitted their readmission application (by following the step-by-step instructions), the information is
sent to the Registrar’s Office where initial processing is completed. They then submit your readmission packet to
our office, and we process everything on our end.
If you have been academically dismissed, we will prepare and send you the graduate readmission contract. Once
we receive the signed copy from you, or if you do not require the readmission contract, we will submit everything
to the Executive Director or Director of OMSCS Advising for review. After they have made their recommendation
as to whether or not your readmission application should be approved, we will submit everything to the Registrar’s
Office for a final decision and processing. You will be notified by their office once a final decision has been made.
Please note that there are different deadlines when you are seeking readmission as a student who has been
academically dismissed versus a student who has taken three or more consecutive semesters off.
Click here to return to Table of Contents
31"
Taking Time Off,3,What is the difference between readmitting versus reapplying to the OMSCS program?,"Readmission is for current OMSCS students who matriculated into the program and then took time off (either
voluntarily or as a result of being academically dismissed). Students are considered to have matriculated if they
registered in at least one course and earned a grade, even if the grade was a withdrawal (“W”).
Reapplying (or submitting a full new application to the OMSCS program) is for admitted students who did not
matriculate and are already outside of their one-year deferral timeframe. For example, if your original application
term is Spring 2024, you would need to reapply to the program if you wish to matriculate after Spring 2025 
To summarize: ●
Current OMSCS students who have been academically dismissed and/or who have taken three or more
consecutive semesters off must seek readmission.
●
Admitted students who have not yet matriculated into the OMSCS program must reapply if they are past
the one-year deferral time frame from their original application term."
Taking Time Off,4,"If I am readmitted, will my previously-earned credits still count?","Yes — your eligible, previously-earned credits will count toward your OMSCS degree if you are approved for
readmission (subject to the six-year program completion rule). To clarify, it is not possible to “start over” or “erase”
your previous academic history, as that always will be a part of your student record."
Taking Time Off,5,What if I need to seek readmission but have not fulfilled my foundational requirement as of yet?,"We will address your foundational requirement as part of the readmission application process, so there is nothing
additional that you need to do regarding this when seeking readmission."
Taking Time Off,6,Is there anything I need to do if I wish to take a semester off?,"If you wish to take a semester off, you simply should not enroll in a course for that term. If you are registered for a
future term, please be sure to drop your course(s) once you have an active time ticket so that you are not charged
tuition/fees. You do not need to notify your advisor or complete/submit any forms. Please keep the readmission
policy in mind, as you will need to seek readmission if you skip three or more consecutive semesters (including
the summer semester).
Also, please remember that Summer registration and Fall Phase I registration may take place at the same time,
unless noted otherwise. If you are planning to skip the summer semester but will enroll for the fall, you should
plan to register for the fall semester during Phase I. If you miss the Phase I registration period, you will have
another chance to enroll during Phase II (though course availability most likely will be more limited)."
Taking Time Off,7,Can I work as a TA during a semester that I am not enrolled in a course?,"OMSCS students can work as a TA during a semester in which they are not enrolled, only if they do not need to
seek readmission. If they are in their third consecutively-skipped semester and will need to seek readmission to
enroll in a future semester, then they are not eligible to be a TA."
Taking Time Off,8,What if I need to take an extended amount of time off from school due to an extenuating circumstance,"(such as required military service, maternity/paternity leave, scheduled surgery, etc.)?
Students may be eligible for an approved Leave of Absence. Please review Section C of the academic catalog for
more information. If you have any questions regarding the Leave of Absence policy, please be sure to contact the
Registrar’s Office directly.
Please note the following regarding the Leave of Absence policy:
●
The Leave of Absence cannot be approved retroactively.
●
An approved Leave of Absence would be effective in a future term. Students on an approved Leave of
Absence would not have to apply for readmission and would be able to retain their email accounts during
the approved absence. Prior to returning, the student would have to notify the Registrar’s Office so that
their record could be reactivated for re-entry.

32


●
The Leave of Absence would cover eligible students for at least three and no more than seven semesters
(including summer). If the seventh semester is a spring term, students may opt to return in either the
summer or fall term.
●
Students on an approved Leave of Absence may not attend class or access other campus services.
●
The form to request an approved Leave of Absence is on the Registrar’s Office’s website.
○
Please be sure to use your advisor’s direct email address (NOT
oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) when submitting this form via DocuSign.
●
The Leave of Absence may be used more than once but for no more than seven total semesters during
the student’s enrollment at Georgia Tech.
●
Students who have been placed on academic drop, suspended, or expelled for disciplinary reasons may
not participate.
●
Students must clear up any other issues such as registration holds or providing any requested
documentation prior to re-entry. The approved Leave of Absence does not override other considerations
or restrictions on enrollment.
●
Students should apply for a Leave of Absence as soon as possible. Applications for a Leave of Absence
will require review and signatures by the Office of the Dean of Students and the student’s major academic
advisor. Other signature approvals, such as the Office of International Education and Financial Aid, also
may need to be obtained.
○
Students should bear in mind the time limits in determining the anticipated date of return.
○
As a reminder, readmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed
(the summer term counts as one of the consecutive semesters, even though students are not
required to enroll in the summer term). However, once students have made the decision that they
will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive terms, and the students wish to return
to Georgia Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed
with the Registrar’s Office.
○
The clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term. The Leave of
Absence would have to be in effect for the third consecutive missed term to avoid readmission.
●
Students must file a Return from Leave of Absence form to return. If the leave exceeds the
seven-semester time frame, the student must apply for readmission. The form is available on the
Registrar’s Office’s website under the “Forms” menu.
●
As stated previously, the Leave of Absence, if approved, would be effective in a future term. It will not be
approved to be effective in the term in which the application is made. It in no way supplants or replaces
any other policy. If a student needs to withdraw from classes within a given term, they should follow the
standard withdrawal process, and if a Leave of Absence is needed or desired, it would be effective for a
future term(s) only as approved.
●
Applications for a Leave of Absence are due by:

Graduation"
Graduation,1,When do students need to apply for graduation?,"Students will need to apply for graduation in the semester preceding the semester they plan to graduate. For
example, students who will be graduating by the end of the Spring 2024 term were asked to apply for graduation
during the Fall 2023 term. OMSCS Advising will send email notifications with step-by-step instructions on how
and when to apply for graduation.
Please note that our departmental deadline is earlier than the posted Institute deadline for students’ benefit. If the
advisors do not have time to process/audit students’ graduation application materials before the registration
period ends for the anticipated graduation term, we cannot ensure that students will meet their degree
requirements by the end of that term."
Graduation,2,What is the process once I apply for graduation?,"After you submit your Online Application for Graduation (OAG) and completed Program of Study (POS) form, your

advisor will conduct several audits on your record to ensure you are on track to graduate by the end of the term:
●
The first audit is completed prior to the start of Phase II registration for your graduation term. The
purpose of this audit is to ensure you are enrolled in the course(s) you need to fulfill your degree
requirements.
●
The second audit is completed after Phase II registration has ended to ensure that you remained
registered in the appropriate course(s).
●
The third audit is completed after the semester’s withdrawal deadline to ensure you did not withdraw from
a course(s) you need to graduate.
●
The final audit is completed after grades have been released for the semester so that we can confirm that
you successfully met all of your degree requirements."
Graduation,3,"When registering for my final semester, what happens if I am waitlisted for a course(s) that I need to graduate, or the wait list for the course(s) I need to graduate is full?","
As we have done in previous semesters, we will ensure that official degree candidates (students who have
submitted the OAG and a completed POS form to their advisor by the departmental deadline) are registered for
the specialization course(s) that they need to graduate. As we are conducting our first audit, we make note of any
degree candidates who are waitlisted for or not yet waitlisted for a specific specialization course(s) that they need.
As we get closer to the Phase II registration period, we will bump these students to the top of the wait list(s).
There may be an exception to this process for specific courses, such as CS 6515, but our office will send detailed
instructions regarding this, if applicable.
Please note that we only do this for specialization courses, not “free” electives.
As with any waitlisted course, please be sure to monitor your account carefully and frequently to ensure that you
do not miss a wait list notification, if you receive one. If you are not yet on the wait list, be sure to monitor the
course, add yourself to the wait list as soon as a space becomes available, and notify your advisor once you are
on the wait list if you need to be prioritized as an official degree candidate."
Graduation,4,What resources should I consult as a degree candidate?,"Please visit the Registrar’s “Degree Candidate” website for helpful information. There are additional links
available on the Commencement website that may be of interest to you, including information regarding the
commencement ceremony. The Commencement Office’s contact information can be found online if you have any
questions."
Graduation,5,Am I invited to participate in the commencement ceremony?,"OMSCS students are invited to participate in the commencement ceremonies. Please note that commencement
ceremonies only take place in the spring and fall terms. If you are a summer graduate, you would be invited to
attend the fall commencement ceremony. For more information regarding commencement ceremonies, please
visit the Commencement website."
Graduation,6,How long after commencement will I receive my diploma?,"Diplomas are printed by an outside company, and it typically takes eight to twelve weeks after the commencement
ceremony for the diplomas to be printed and mailed."
Graduation,7,Who should I contact if I need to update my diploma address or if I have other questions regarding my,"diploma?

updating your diploma address or if you have any other questions regarding your diploma."
Graduation,8,"I have applied to graduate by the end of the semester, and I need a document to prove this. Are there any","documents that the Institute can provide to show that I am approaching my graduation date?
As per the Registrar’s website, “[s]tudents who have petitioned for a degree for the term may request a letter
stating that they have a ‘pending’ degree and that the degree will be awarded when all requirements for the
degree are completed. This option is not available for students who have already been awarded a degree.
Students who wish to have verification of an awarded degree should request a Degree Verification instead.”
Please visit the website linked above for more information on how to request this letter."
Graduation,9,"If I am not sure that I will meet the degree requirements by the end of the term, am I still permitted to","attend the commencement ceremony?
Since grades are not finalized until after the commencement ceremony, there have been times when students

have attended the commencement ceremony but unfortunately did not earn the grade(s) they needed. In this
case, the student would need to enroll in a future term in order to fulfill the degree requirements.
Therefore, if you are a degree candidate and have followed the steps on the Commencement Office’s website to
attend the ceremony, you should be eligible to attend, even if you are not sure you will obtain the grade(s) you
need. Please feel free to contact the Commencement Office directly if you have additional questions regarding
this. As a reminder, the Commencement Office’s contact information can be found online."
Graduation,10,When will I know that I completed my degree requirements and will graduate from the OMSCS program?,"Grades typically are released on the Tuesday after the commencement ceremony. Our office performs the final
degree audit once grades have been posted so that degrees can be conferred by the Thursday of that same
week. Therefore, as explained previously, it unfortunately is possible for students to attend the commencement
ceremony and later discover that they did not earn the grade(s) they needed to fulfill the degree requirements.
We will notify students if this is the case, but fortunately this does not happen often."
Graduation,11,What happens if I apply to graduate and do not meet the degree requirements by the end of that term?,"If you did not meet the degree requirements by the end of the term for which you applied to graduate, your
graduation application would be inactivated. To clarify, these are the most common reasons why your graduation
application would need to be inactivated:
●
You did not register for the courses you needed to fulfill your degree requirements by the end of the term.
●
You withdrew from a course(s) you needed to fulfill your degree requirements by the end of the term.
●
You did not earn the grade(s) you needed to fulfill your degree requirements.
●
You did not earn the overall cumulative 3.0 GPA requirement.
Once your graduation application was inactivated, you would need to re-apply for graduation and submit updated
graduation materials as instructed by OMSCS Advising for your new anticipated graduation term."
Graduation,12,"What happens if I pass my courses and fulfill my course/specialization requirements, but my cumulative GPA is below 3.0?","Even if you complete your courses and ultimately fulfill your course/specialization requirements for the MSCS
degree, you cannot graduate from the OMSCS program if your cumulative GPA is not 3.0 or higher. Therefore,
you would be required to take additional courses beyond the required 30 hours in order to increase your GPA and
meet the minimum requirement of a 3. 
0 Please be sure to contact your advisor directly for further guidance, especially if you are considering repeating a course, as students cannot repeat courses in which the grade of “B”
or higher has been earned previously."
Graduation,13,Is it possible to graduate with honors/distinctions from the OMSCS program?,"Graduating with distinction/honors is not available at the graduate level at Georgia Tech. Please visit
https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/degree-candidate-faq#about-honors for more information."
Graduation,14,Can I continue taking OMSCS courses after I graduate from the program?,"It is possible for students to continue taking courses after they have graduated. In the semester you are
graduating, you should tell your academic advisor (after your graduating term’s withdrawal deadline) that you wish
to become a special/non-degree student in the next (or in a future) term. Term-specific information regarding the
exact timeline and deadline to submit the required form should be available after that term’s withdrawal deadline.
To confirm, special/non-degree requests are not processed until after degrees have been awarded by the
Registrar’s Office at the end of the term, as the advisors do not want to request the status change in the
unfortunate event that a student did not fulfill the degree requirements that term as planned.
Please keep in mind the following regarding the special/non-degree student status:
●
You will continue paying OMSCS tuition and fees.
●
You will have a later registration time ticket than most degree-seeking students.
●
The same rule applies in that if special/non-degree students do not enroll for three consecutive terms
(including the summer term), they have to apply for readmission.
●
The special/non-degree status will last until you apply for another program at Georgia Tech.
●
There is no overall limit on how many courses you can take as a special/non-degree student.
●
You would earn credits in the sense that if you wanted to transfer them to another institution, you could.
However, at Georgia Tech, the credits would not count for anything.
●
Courses taken as a special/non-degree student will alter your GPA because the GPA does not start over

with a new class standing. However, for the purposes of your resume, whatever your GPA was when
your degree was awarded will be your MS GPA.
●
Courses taken as a special/non-degree student will appear on your transcript and become a part of your
student record (this is not optional)."
Graduation,15,Can I continue being a TA after I graduate from the program?,"This is possible, but it is more complicated than taking courses after graduating. You would have to be hired as a
part-time instructor. The hiring takes more time, and you have to consent to a background check. Therefore, you
should be absolutely sure that you really want to continue being a TA before you apply.
Also, please note that international students who are not living in the U.S. most likely cannot be hired as TAs, as
the Institute has to be able to verify your identity and conduct a background check, and you have to have a Social
Security number to do this. International students who are not living in the U.S. may not work as TAs for free.
Unless we hire them as a TA, there is no way of holding them accountable for their work as a TA."
