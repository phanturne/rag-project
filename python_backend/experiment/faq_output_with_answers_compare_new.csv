Phase II registration period has ended, they will have a record of enrollment for the semester and will be
considered a matriculated (current) student. This is true even if a student later decides to withdraw from a course
by the semester’s deadline, as the “W” on the transcript will still count as a record of enrollment for the semester.

How do I know if I need to submit a deferral request?,"Please note the following when determining whether a deferral request needs to be submitted:
●
If a student registers and remains enrolled after Phase II registration has ended, they are considered a
matriculated (current) OMSCS student and do not need to request to defer their admission, even if they
withdraw from a course in their first semester.
●
If a student registers but drops their schedule before Phase II registration has ended, they are not
considered a matriculated (current) OMSCS student and must submit a request to defer their admission
within the designated time frame, as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. Please review the
previous FAQs for more details.

If you are considering deferring your admission only because you cannot enroll in the specific course(s) you wish
to take, we strongly do not recommend pursuing the deferral, as you will be in the same situation the next term
since new students do not register until Phase II.","Yes, it may be possible to defer your admission if you are unable to enroll in the course you want due to it being full.

Why is there a limit on the number of seats for each course if this is an online program?,"While we do not have physical space constraints, there are other factors that have to be taken into consideration
for an online program this size. One example is that in order to maintain the integrity and academic rigor of the
program, we have to hire an adequate number of TAs per a specific number of enrolled students. This is why we
limit the number of waitlisted courses for each student so that we have a realistic idea of the demand for each
course and can hire TAs accordingly (whenever possible). Additionally, some courses are unable to scale above
a certain maximum while still providing an effective learning experience for students.","The limit on the number of seats for each course in an online program is not due to physical space constraints but is necessary to maintain the program's integrity and academic rigor. One reason for this limit is the need to hire an adequate number of Teaching Assistants (TAs) per a specific number of enrolled students. By limiting the number of seats, the program can better manage TA resources and ensure a quality educational experience.

The limit on the number of seats also helps the program understand the demand for each course and hire TAs accordingly. Some courses may have a maximum capacity that, if exceeded, could compromise the effectiveness of the learning experience for students. Therefore, setting a limit on seats allows for a balance between demand, resources, and maintaining a high-quality educational environment.","The limit on the number of seats for each course in an online program is due to factors such as hiring an adequate number of TAs per a specific number of enrolled students to maintain the integrity and academic rigor of the program.

Why is my wait list position increasing instead of decreasing?,"Each semester, we prioritize the degree candidates on wait lists if they need a specific specialization course (not
“free” elective) to graduate by the end of the term. Therefore, your wait list position could change due to degree
candidates receiving priority. We hope that students will understand this, as we will do the same for you once you
are in your final term and are preparing to graduate.","Your wait list position could be increasing instead of decreasing because degree candidates needing a specific course to graduate are given priority, which can affect the movement on the wait list.

Can I take a semester off?,"OMSCS students may take up to two consecutive semesters off at any time after they have matriculated into the
OMSCS program. However, if you take three or more consecutive semesters off, you must apply for readmission.
Please note that the summer term counts as one of the consecutive semesters, even though students are not
required to enroll in the summer term. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee you will be readmitted. For more
information, please review the Registrar's Readmission Policy.
To clarify, if a student enrolls in a course and withdraws (which would result in a “W” on the student’s transcript),
this counts as a record of enrollment for that semester and does not count as sitting out for the semester.
Therefore, the student would need to sit out the next three consecutive semesters before needing to apply for
readmission. If a student drops a course, this does not count as a record of enrollment, and this would be
considered as sitting out a semester.
Please see the FAQ section entitled “Registration-Related Information” for a detailed explanation of the
difference between dropping and withdrawing from a course.
Please note: If you are a newly-admitted student and are not planning to attend your first semester, you will need
to submit a request to defer your admission. Please refer to the “Deferring Admission” section of the FAQ for
more information about how and when to submit this request.","Yes, you can take a semester off by simply not enrolling in any courses for that term. If you are registered for a future term, you should drop your courses to avoid being charged tuition/fees. Keep in mind that taking three or more consecutive semesters off may require you to seek readmission.","Yes, you can take a semester off. To do so, simply do not enroll in a course for that term and drop any registered courses to avoid tuition and fee charges. If you take three or more consecutive semesters off, you will need to apply for readmission.",1.23,2.66
What is the process once students seek readmission?,"Students must complete the step-by-step instructions on the Registrar’s readmission website. After they have
successfully submitted their readmission application (by following the step-by-step instructions), the information is
sent to the Registrar’s Office where initial processing is completed. They then submit your readmission packet to
our office, and we process everything on our end.
If you have been academically dismissed, we will prepare and send you the graduate readmission contract. Once
we receive the signed copy from you, or if you do not require the readmission contract, we will submit everything
to the Executive Director or Director of OMSCS Advising for review. After they have made their recommendation
as to whether or not your readmission application should be approved, we will submit everything to the Registrar’s
Office for a final decision and processing. You will be notified by their office once a final decision has been made.
Please note that there are different deadlines when you are seeking readmission as a student who has been
academically dismissed versus a student who has taken three or more consecutive semesters off.

Readmission is for current OMSCS students who previously matriculated into the program and took time off, and students are considered to have matriculated if they registered in at least one course and earned a grade, even if it was a withdrawal (""W""). Foundational requirements are addressed as part of the readmission application process, so there are no additional steps needed in this regard for students seeking readmission.","The process once students seek readmission is that they must complete the step-by-step instructions on the Registrar's readmission website, and after submitting their application, the information is sent to the Registrar's Office for initial processing.

What is the difference between readmitting versus reapplying to the OMSCS program?,"Readmission is for current OMSCS students who matriculated into the program and then took time off (either
voluntarily or as a result of being academically dismissed). Students are considered to have matriculated if they
registered in at least one course and earned a grade, even if the grade was a withdrawal (“W”).
Reapplying (or submitting a full new application to the OMSCS program) is for admitted students who did not
matriculate and are already outside of their one-year deferral timeframe. For example, if your original application
term is Spring 2024, you would need to reapply to the program if you wish to matriculate after Spring 2025 
To summarize: ●
Current OMSCS students who have been academically dismissed and/or who have taken three or more
consecutive semesters off must seek readmission.
●
Admitted students who have not yet matriculated into the OMSCS program must reapply if they are past
the one-year deferral time frame from their original application term.","The difference between readmitting and reapplying to the OMSCS program lies in the student's status: readmission is for current OMSCS students who took time off after matriculating, while reapplying is for admitted students who did not matriculate within one year of their original application term. Readmission is specifically for students who were previously matriculated but took a break, while reapplying is for admitted students who never matriculated into the program.","Readmitting is for current OMSCS students who have been academically dismissed or took three or more consecutive semesters off, whereas reapplying is for admitted students who did not matriculate and are outside of their one-year deferral timeframe.

Students may be eligible for an approved Leave of Absence. Please review Section C of the academic catalog for
more information. If you have any questions regarding the Leave of Absence policy, please be sure to contact the
Registrar’s Office directly.
Please note the following regarding the Leave of Absence policy:
●
The Leave of Absence cannot be approved retroactively.
●
An approved Leave of Absence would be effective in a future term. Students on an approved Leave of
Absence would not have to apply for readmission and would be able to retain their email accounts during
the approved absence. Prior to returning, the student would have to notify the Registrar’s Office so that
their record could be reactivated for re-entry.

●
The Leave of Absence would cover eligible students for at least three and no more than seven semesters
(including summer). If the seventh semester is a spring term, students may opt to return in either the
summer or fall term.
●
Students on an approved Leave of Absence may not attend class or access other campus services.
●
The form to request an approved Leave of Absence is on the Registrar’s Office’s website.
○
Please be sure to use your advisor’s direct email address (NOT
oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) when submitting this form via DocuSign.
●
The Leave of Absence may be used more than once but for no more than seven total semesters during
the student’s enrollment at Georgia Tech.
●
Students who have been placed on academic drop, suspended, or expelled for disciplinary reasons may
not participate.
●
Students must clear up any other issues such as registration holds or providing any requested
documentation prior to re-entry. The approved Leave of Absence does not override other considerations
or restrictions on enrollment.
●
Students should apply for a Leave of Absence as soon as possible. Applications for a Leave of Absence
will require review and signatures by the Office of the Dean of Students and the student’s major academic
advisor. Other signature approvals, such as the Office of International Education and Financial Aid, also
may need to be obtained.
○
Students should bear in mind the time limits in determining the anticipated date of return.
○
As a reminder, readmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed
(the summer term counts as one of the consecutive semesters, even though students are not
required to enroll in the summer term). However, once students have made the decision that they
will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive terms, and the students wish to return
to Georgia Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed
with the Registrar’s Office.
○
The clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term. The Leave of
Absence would have to be in effect for the third consecutive missed term to avoid readmission.
●
Students must file a Return from Leave of Absence form to return. If the leave exceeds the
seven-semester time frame, the student must apply for readmission. The form is available on the
Registrar’s Office’s website under the “Forms” menu.
●
As stated previously, the Leave of Absence, if approved, would be effective in a future term. It will not be
approved to be effective in the term in which the application is made. It in no way supplants or replaces
any other policy. If a student needs to withdraw from classes within a given term, they should follow the
standard withdrawal process, and if a Leave of Absence is needed or desired, it would be effective for a
future term(s) only as approved.

Also, please note that international students who are not living in the U.S. most likely cannot be hired as TAs, as
the Institute has to be able to verify your identity and conduct a background check, and you have to have a Social
Security number to do this. International students who are not living in the U.S. may not work as TAs for free.
Unless we hire them as a TA, there is no way of holding them accountable for their work as a TA.","After graduating from the program, it is possible to continue being a TA, but it involves being hired as a part-time instructor, which is more complex than taking courses. You would need to go through a hiring process that includes consenting to a background check. Make sure you are certain about wanting to continue as a TA before applying for the position.","Yes, it is possible to continue being a TA after graduating from the program, but it is more complicated and requires being hired as a part-time instructor, which involves a longer hiring process and a background check.",1.43,2.25
