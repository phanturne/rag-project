an OMSCS course or take it on the “Pass/Fail” grading basis.
The one exception are the CS 8001 seminars, as those are graded on the “Pass/Fail” grading basis. As a
reminder, these will NOT count toward your graduation requirements.
You might notice that other courses, such as those offered through the OMS Analytics and OMS Cybersecurity
programs, have the “ALP” grading basis, which stands for “Audit”, “Letter Grade”, and “Pass/Fail”. As a reminder,
courses with the “OAN” section are for OMS Analytics students only, and courses with the “OCY” section are for
OMS Cybersecurity students only – OMSCS students are NOT permitted to enroll in these sections. If a section

information, please review the Registrar's Readmission Policy.
To clarify, if a student enrolls in a course and withdraws (which would result in a “W” on the student’s transcript),
this counts as a record of enrollment for that semester and does not count as sitting out for the semester.

readmission. If a student drops a course, this does not count as a record of enrollment, and this would be
considered as sitting out a semester.

Students may be eligible for an approved Leave of Absence. Please review Section C of the academic catalog for
more information. If you have any questions regarding the Leave of Absence policy, please be sure to contact the
Registrar’s Office directly.
Please note the following regarding the Leave of Absence policy:
●
The Leave of Absence cannot be approved retroactively.
●
An approved Leave of Absence would be effective in a future term. Students on an approved Leave of
Absence would not have to apply for readmission and would be able to retain their email accounts during
the approved absence. Prior to returning, the student would have to notify the Registrar’s Office so that
their record could be reactivated for re-entry.

●
The Leave of Absence would cover eligible students for at least three and no more than seven semesters
(including summer). If the seventh semester is a spring term, students may opt to return in either the
summer or fall term.
●
Students on an approved Leave of Absence may not attend class or access other campus services.
●
The form to request an approved Leave of Absence is on the Registrar’s Office’s website.
○
Please be sure to use your advisor’s direct email address (NOT
oms-advising@cc.gatech.edu) when submitting this form via DocuSign.
●
The Leave of Absence may be used more than once but for no more than seven total semesters during
the student’s enrollment at Georgia Tech.
●
Students who have been placed on academic drop, suspended, or expelled for disciplinary reasons may
not participate.
●
Students must clear up any other issues such as registration holds or providing any requested
documentation prior to re-entry. The approved Leave of Absence does not override other considerations
or restrictions on enrollment.
●
Students should apply for a Leave of Absence as soon as possible. Applications for a Leave of Absence
will require review and signatures by the Office of the Dean of Students and the student’s major academic
advisor. Other signature approvals, such as the Office of International Education and Financial Aid, also
may need to be obtained.
○
Students should bear in mind the time limits in determining the anticipated date of return.
○
As a reminder, readmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed
(the summer term counts as one of the consecutive semesters, even though students are not
required to enroll in the summer term). However, once students have made the decision that they
will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive terms, and the students wish to return
to Georgia Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed
with the Registrar’s Office.
○
The clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term. The Leave of
Absence would have to be in effect for the third consecutive missed term to avoid readmission.
●
Students must file a Return from Leave of Absence form to return. If the leave exceeds the
seven-semester time frame, the student must apply for readmission. The form is available on the
Registrar’s Office’s website under the “Forms” menu.
●
As stated previously, the Leave of Absence, if approved, would be effective in a future term. It will not be
approved to be effective in the term in which the application is made. It in no way supplants or replaces
any other policy. If a student needs to withdraw from classes within a given term, they should follow the
standard withdrawal process, and if a Leave of Absence is needed or desired, it would be effective for a
future term(s) only as approved.

What happens if I apply to graduate and do not meet the degree requirements by the end of that term?,"If you did not meet the degree requirements by the end of the term for which you applied to graduate, your

Can I continue taking OMSCS courses after I graduate from the program?,"It is possible for students to continue taking courses after they have graduated. In the semester you are
graduating, you should tell your academic advisor (after your graduating term’s withdrawal deadline) that you wish
to become a special/non-degree student in the next (or in a future) term. Term-specific information regarding the
exact timeline and deadline to submit the required form should be available after that term’s withdrawal deadline.
To confirm, special/non-degree requests are not processed until after degrees have been awarded by the
Registrar’s Office at the end of the term, as the advisors do not want to request the status change in the
unfortunate event that a student did not fulfill the degree requirements that term as planned.
Please keep in mind the following regarding the special/non-degree student status:
●
You will continue paying OMSCS tuition and fees.
●
You will have a later registration time ticket than most degree-seeking students.
●
The same rule applies in that if special/non-degree students do not enroll for three consecutive terms
(including the summer term), they have to apply for readmission.
●
The special/non-degree status will last until you apply for another program at Georgia Tech.
●
There is no overall limit on how many courses you can take as a special/non-degree student.
●
You would earn credits in the sense that if you wanted to transfer them to another institution, you could.
However, at Georgia Tech, the credits would not count for anything.

Can I continue being a TA after I graduate from the program?,"This is possible, but it is more complicated than taking courses after graduating. You would have to be hired as a
part-time instructor. The hiring takes more time, and you have to consent to a background check. Therefore, you
should be absolutely sure that you really want to continue being a TA before you apply.
Also, please note that international students who are not living in the U.S. most likely cannot be hired as TAs, as
the Institute has to be able to verify your identity and conduct a background check, and you have to have a Social
Security number to do this. International students who are not living in the U.S. may not work as TAs for free.
